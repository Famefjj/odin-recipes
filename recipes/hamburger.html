  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>feta cheese stuffed hamburger make it creamy 
    and delicious</p>

  <h2>Ingredient</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>1 pound lean ground beef </li>
    <li>Â½ teaspoon Worcestershire sauce </li>
    <li>1 teaspoon dried parsley </li>
    <li>salt and pepper to taste </li>
    <li>1 cup crumbled feta cheese </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li><p>Preheat an outdoor grill for medium heat, 
      and lightly oil the grate.</p></li>

    <li><p>Knead together the ground beef, 
      Worcestershire sauce, parsley, salt, 
      and pepper in a bowl. Form the mixture 
      into 8 equal-sized balls; flatten to make 
      thin patties. Place about 1/4 cup of feta 
      cheese onto each of four of the patties. 
      Top each of the patties with cheese with 
      one of the patties without; press the 
      edges together to seal the cheese 
      into the center.</p></li>

    <li><p>Cook on the preheated grill until the 
      burgers are cooked to your desired degree 
      of doneness, 7 to 8 minutes per side 
      for well done. An instant-read thermometer 
      inserted into the center should 
      read 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).</p></li>
